# 42pipex

pipex is a 42 school project aimed to better understand shell redirection and pipes..

This pipex program takes an input file, performs a command on it, pipes the result to another command which then writes its result to an output file. The result is virtually identical to this kind of shell command:
```
$ < input_file command1 | command2 > output file
```
